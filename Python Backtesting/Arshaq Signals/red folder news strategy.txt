red folder news strategy

steps - 
1 - 
DETERMINE DAILY BIAS 
- go to daily candle 
- get trend 
- point out trend low or high
- point out fair value gaps
- point out liq pools
- get previous session lows and highs
- determine if asia highs and lows are taken out in London session

ON RED FOLDER NEWS DAY do this on 15 mins chart  
- mark out liq pools from previous sessions
- wait for huge candle to form (green or red)
- wait till new York session
- confirm if price was in the liq pool range as identified earlier (this initiates sell side liq pool move bias)
- mark out following fair value gaps occurring just outside of liq pool hit
- wait for FVGs to be filled
- prompt after 3 candles of fill (depending on candle timeframe) ONLY DURING NEW YORK SESSION

EXIT (not to be implemented currently
- target based approach
- targets 1 : liq pools marked out from prev sessions
