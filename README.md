AlphaStrat is a real-time financial trading solution that integrates multiple market data sources, including the Alpaca API, with support for WebSocket streaming and future expansion to support additional adapters, analytics, and pricing. The system is designed for multi-threaded, scalable strategies, and real-time processing of Level 1-3 data.

## Current Features

- **Alpaca Integration:** Real-time market data streaming from Alpaca via WebSockets, with support for trade updates, order updates, and account events.
- **Adapter Architecture:** Modular design that allows for easy integration of new data sources or functionality through custom adapters.
- **C++20 Standards:** Built using modern C++20 features, ensuring efficient and high-performance execution.
- **WebSocket Integration:** Supports real-time streaming of data using WebSocket++ for live market updates.
- **nlohmann::json Integration:** JSON parsing for handling API responses, including authentication and market data subscriptions.

## Architecture

The architecture follows a modular design with several layers:
- **Adapter Layer:** Adapters for each market data source (currently Alpaca, with more sources planned).

- **Cache System:** Implementation of a caching layer to store frequently accessed data and enhance performance.
- **Strategy Execution in Parallel:** Run multiple trading strategies concurrently for different instruments or market conditions.
- **Adapter Expansion:** Add support for additional market data sources like Binance, Reuters, or IEX for seamless integration.
- **Market Data Aggregator:** Build an aggregator to merge data from multiple sources, offering consolidated market views.
- **Pricing Library:** Develop a library for pricing financial instruments using models like Black-Scholes, Monte Carlo simulations, and more.
